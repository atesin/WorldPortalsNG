# WorldPortalsNG portals data file.
# 
# Do not modify or portals could get corrupted, many calculations are made
# after portals load, e.g. links network, structural blocks, distances, etc.
#
# With WorldPortalsNG v1 you can migrate from WorldPortals seamlessly
# just by replacing this file with the data.yml file from previous plugin,
# both plugins cannot coexist so you should disable WorldPortals before start.
# Download it from https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/world-portals-ng/files
# SHUT THE SERVER DOWN AND MAKE A FULL BACKUP BEFORE PROCEED
